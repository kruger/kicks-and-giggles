## Original code from :
## Robin Camille Davis

## downloads all items in a given Internet Archive collection
## !! will probably crash after 10 or so items !! feel free to edit the script to make it better for bigger collections
## See http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/data-mining-the-internet-archive for more detailed info

import time
import sys
import internetarchive as ia

from internetarchive import get_item
from internetarchive import download

    num = num + 1 #item count
    itemid = result['identifier']
    print 'Downloading: #' + str(num) + '\t' + itemid
    try:
	download(itemid) 
        print '\t\t Download success.'
    except Exception , e:
        print "Error Occurred downloading () = {}".format(itemid, e) 
    print 'Pausing for 40 minutes'
    time.sleep(2400) # IA restricts the number of things you can download. Be nice to 
                     # their servers -- limit how much you download, too. For me, this
                     # time restriction is still not polite enough, and my connection gets
                     # cut off all the dang time.
